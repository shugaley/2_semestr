# Some Words About Compiler Optimization

Ok. I did it. Compiler has been finished. This year of endless proga has been finished. 

I measured the average acceleration. lang_input_test.txt was used for this (there are calculations of 8! N-times).
There are results:

Not bad (acceleration is about 900).
But it became obvious that this can be done even faster after analyzing the resulting code in edb.
